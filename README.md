# SublimePicker

A customizable view that provisions picking of a date, time & recurrence option, all from a single user-interface. You can also view 'SublimePicker' as a collection of material-styled (API 23) DatePicker, TimePicker & RecurrencePicker, backported to API 14.

With the release of version 2, SublimePicker now allows date-range selection.

All three components have been converted to views, which enables us to add/embed them anywhere - add them to a 'Dialog', a 'PopupWindow', or use them as any regular android widget. 

Almost all styling possibilities have been exposed through attrs. If something has been missed, please bring it to my attention.

SublimePicker provides a single point of entry to all three pickers. What I mean is that once SublimePicker is available for interaction, the user can select a date, a time & a recurrence option without leaving the picker.

</p>

Version 2 allows date-range selection using `SublimeOptions#setCanPickDateRange(boolean)`. Picking date range is _one fluent gesture_ which begins with a long-press on the intended start-date, followed by a drag onto the intended end-date. The range can span as many days, months or years, as needed. During a drag, approaching the left/right edge of date picker scrolls the previous/next month into view.  

Date range selection:
